### Fixed

- **Fallback Logic**: Fixed critical bug where fallback wasn't working properly
  - Improved `findInNamespace` method to handle `undefined` values correctly
  - Fixed fallback direction: English → Korean (instead of English → English)
  - Enhanced `getNestedValue` checks for proper fallback chain execution
- **Missing Key Handling**: Better development vs production environment handling
  - Development: Shows `[MISSING: key]` for debugging
  - Production: Shows user-friendly fallback messages

### Added

- **Korean-First Translation**: Complete Korean translation for all demo UI elements
  - All developer messages, placeholders, and UI text fully translated
  - Korean as primary language with English as secondary
  - Comprehensive translation coverage including error messages
- **Perfect Demo Experience**: Outstanding Next.js demo with real fallback examples
  - True fallback demonstration: Korean-only keys fallback properly in English mode
  - Interactive language switching with visual feedback
  - Real-time status display and dynamic content updates
  - Professional UI/UX with smooth animations and modern design
- **Enhanced Language Switcher**: Improved dropdown with fixed width and better UX
  - Consistent layout without size changes when expanded
  - Smooth animations and hover effects
  - Better visual hierarchy and accessibility

### Changed

- **Demo Configuration**: Updated fallback language to Korean for proper demo behavior
  - `fallbackLanguage: 'ko'` ensures English → Korean fallback
  - Better demonstration of fallback capabilities
- **Documentation**: Updated all examples and guides to reflect new features
- **Code Quality**: Improved error handling and type safety throughout

### Migration Guide

This release is fully backward compatible. The main change is improved fallback behavior, which should work more reliably in all scenarios.
